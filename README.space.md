# Animal Spotter (Space build)

This trimmed-down folder is generated by `scripts/prepare_space_upload.py` and
only contains the pieces that Hugging Face Spaces needs to run the Gradio demo:

- `src/gradio_app.py` and its Python dependencies.
- `data/processed/classes.yaml` so the demo knows the label mapping.
- Up to four sample images from `data/images/test/` for the Examples widget.
- Optionally, the minimal set of model files from `models/detr-finetuned/`
  (`config.json`, `model.safetensors`, `preprocessor_config.json`).

The complete project (training scripts, Docker stack, notebooks, etc.) lives in
the main repository: https://github.com/<owner>/animal_spotter

## Local testing

Install the lightweight requirements and launch the demo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.gradio_app --checkpoint models/detr-finetuned --share
```

Set the `MODEL_DIR` environment variable (for example in the Space settings) if
you want the app to automatically load a checkpoint that you copied into this
folder before running `gradio deploy`.
