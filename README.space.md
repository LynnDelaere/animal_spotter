# Animal Spotter (Space build)

This trimmed-down folder is generated by `scripts/prepare_space_upload.py` and
only contains the pieces that Hugging Face Spaces needs to run the Gradio demo:

- `src/gradio_app.py`, the FastAPI helpers and the model catalog describing
  available checkpoints.
- `data/processed/**/*.yaml` label maps referenced by the catalog entries.
- Up to four sample images from `data/images/test/` for the Examples widget.
- Optionally, the minimal set of model files from `models/detr-finetuned/`
  (`config.json`, `model.safetensors`, `preprocessor_config.json`).

The complete project (training scripts, Docker stack, notebooks, etc.) lives in
the main repository: https://github.com/<owner>/animal_spotter

## Local testing

Install the lightweight requirements and launch the demo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.gradio_app --model-catalog configs/model_catalog.yaml --share
```

Set `MODEL_CATALOG` (or fall back to `MODEL_DIR` for single-model deployments) in
the Space settings if you move the catalog/checkpoints to a non-default path
after preparing the upload folder.
